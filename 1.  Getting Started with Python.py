# Why companies use Python
print "Python is an easy to learn programming language"
print """It has a very steep learning curve which means one have to invest less time to get things going than
with some other programming languages like C/C++ or Java."""
print """Python is not strictly a programming language it is a description of a programming language.
This makes different implementations available which are implemented with different programming languages."""
print "Python is used broadly among developers for ETL, gaming, web development, system automation and testing."
print """Dropbox started with Python and stayed with it and when they realized it they served 40 million
users with their codebase. The reason for using Python was that they could write functionality in 100
lines of code which would have required 1000 lines with another language like C/C++ or Java."""
# Python is very fast growing language in the industry.
